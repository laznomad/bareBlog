      "content_html": "<h3><strong>From consulting to the sewers of the internet</strong></h3>\nAt some point in my consulting years, I had reached I point I totally lost the motivation to move forward. Get assigned a project, do interviews, kick-offs, hunk down in a room for a bunch of hours and work out a deck with some obvious stuff but nicely presented and, after a round of multiple reviews, get it presented out to some director. Consulting firm and client goals and necessarily diverging (firm wants to bill as much as possible, client doesn't really know what too do and expect a deus ex machina to show up and fix everything) and the whole exercise slowly lost any reason to be in my mind and became more and more pointless.\n\nConsulting is soulless, uninspiring and requires to develop a good level of detachment from reality while having an extremely good grasp on a specific subject and being abrrrrrrle to seamlessly move from the most tactic to the most strategic level of thinking. You develop some amazing sales and problem solving skills which would definitely pay dividends in later stages of your life, but on a day-to-day basis can be pretty soul crushing. The competitiveness, long hours and constant pressure can be hard to bear.\n\nSometimes I cringe when I think about the excitement and drive I had back in those days and I'm still amazed and how much I was able to accomplish with so little sleep. At some point all the excitement vanished and some weird type of anti-capitalistic pragmatism woke me up - this was all a huge waste of time, I had to make a change.\n\nI had made up my mind already when a friend reached out and talked me into joining a local startup. In all honesty, I had not really understood their business model at first - I was told it was a new affiliate network that developed their own programmatic attribution technology - but I quickly learned that the worst reason to join a company is to having to leave your current one as soon as possible. I wasn't really asking any questions anyway, I just wanted to leave and maybe spend a few months thinking about next steps. And that is usually easier with a paycheck, or so I thought.\n<h3>What do companies really get when they buy programmatic media plans</h3>\nI join an office with less than 10 people, one recent MBA graduate, 3 interns who would be forced to constantly renewing their internship to prevent them from be hired full time and two founders. Their pitch? In short, they helped advertisers generate leads and clicks by bundling ads with free software. You know the kind: those handy little tools like PDF converters or video players you download without thinking twice. At face value, seemed very legit and regular business. From a financial standpoint they were also doing reasonably well. The company was a spin off from a local media agency and it was constantly fed new clients eager to receive traffic and leads and run their promos.\n\nAt that time, there were a handful of internet portals which were able to rank for the top spots for high volume keywords related to the most common software. Users would land on their pages first rather than go to the actual company developing the software to download the latest versions. The portal would monetize both traffic and downloads allowing third party to bundle their own installers with said software. At that time, there was very little transparency on what was actually getting bundled together.\n\nSEO was absolutely fundamental for these businesses - a few years later, a famous <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/panda-update/\">Google update</a> removed a bunch of these sites almost completely from those SERPs. At some point in Mountain View, someone realized that you should not boost rankings of a third party software installer or at least prioritize them over the legit software source. One of this companies in particular, had to <a href=\"https://googleseo.marketing/el-caso-softonic-o-como-google-puede-hundir-tu-empresa/\">layoff 30% of its workforce</a> due to the loss in traffic and the impact to their bottom line. Needless to say, they should have probably shut down altogether - they only contributed to make the internet a much worse place than what it really is.\n\nWhat was my role? The whole thing was so poorly glued together that they were struggling even issuing anything resembling a P&amp;L sheet so I initially focused on the analytics and tracking side of the business, while pursuing a few different unrelated projects, as usually happens in small teams. But my scope was so poorly defined that I started struggling exactly what it was really needed versus what the founders really wanted. Needless to say I quickly understand this was not going to last for long.\n<h3>The Installer: where things got murky</h3>\nThe company had a legitimate affiliate marketing business but they added their own spin to it, or so they though. Within a few days, I was introduced to the company's secret weapon: an installer program that partnered with popular free software developers. The idea was simple\u2014ads were bundled with free software downloads, reaching millions of users daily and therefore creating a massive market waiting to be monetized.\n\nThe installers weren\u2019t just delivering free software. Hidden in the fine print of the install process was a checkbox\u2014selected by default\u2014that agreed to \u201cthird-party offers.\u201d In reality, these offers weren\u2019t harmless ads. They were paired with an \u201cagent\u201d that secretly installed alongside the software. That agent was effectively a <strong>keylogger</strong>.\n\nBy this point, you should be already thinking of those annoying browser toolbar which were just so hard to remove. This was a step ahead of that. No visible toolbar, just a hidden agent downloaded unbeknownst to the user which would run in the background.\n\nHaving a non-browser specific agent would have allowed for some more flexibility and not having to deal with any of the Microsoft or Google guidelines for developers. On the other hand, this also implied a different type of challenge - the agent was a legit executable running in the background, outside the scope of the browser.\n\nNow you might think that any commercial anti-virus or anti-malware software at that time was able to flag these installers. And in fact they were, although not as frequently as you might imagine. Out of 100 unique downloads, about 30 would never ping our servers, therefore we assumed they were flagged. This was a significant issue since if one installer gets flagged, their signature is shared across a network of security providers and multiple anti-virus software would have also identified it as a threat from that moment on. That would have been a critical threat, as the whole botnet would have potentially died overnight. As I remember, this was causing significant stress for the founders, as they started hiring foreign consultants which very interesting backgrounds in malware and security. We worked with a number of people from eastern Europe, likely legit black-hat operators, sometime trying to scramble a last minute update because we got word that some antivirus just flagged us. It was a constant cat-and-mouse game.\n\nThe crazy thing I recall is that everybody in the office was so oblivious to anything it was happening - both because of lack of knowledge or really understanding the impact of what we were doing. All this while you could hear consultants in the background talking about code <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)\">obfuscation</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)\">polymorphism</a>, packing and all sorts of techniques trying to bypass the latest antivirus update.\n\nDownload portals where also part of this since they run their own check on the installers being bundled. But guess what, they never raised a flag, since they never did their diligence. They were in fact a primary source for malware, although it took a few years for Google to truly make some changes and stop their SERP predominance.\n\nThe funny thing\u00a0 was also that the more they trying to hide and disguise the agent was generating more issues than the agent itself. Antivirus are primed also on these techniques, so they might even skip on recognizing the original pattern of the agent as malicious, but clearly pick up if someone is trying to hiding something in the code, no matter what it is.\n\nSo what was a really strong business on paper, was hinged on some very precarious technical balance. The whole thing could have shut down overnight due to some large scale antivirus or malware update.\n<h3>The truth about <em>performance</em> and <em>programmatic</em> advertising</h3>\nAs I started analyzing the ad performance, click-through rates were way above industry benchmarks. Clearly the agent were matching user search queries with relevant offers. While conversion rate were still extremely low, the sheer volume of traffic was enough that a minuscule conversion would have generated a significant upside anyway.\n\nOften, users clicked on these ads out of frustration or confusion, not genuine interest. And they would get another $0.10 in CPC. Then you get funneled into some weird form promising some rewards, and then bang, they made another $5 in CPL. And so it goes. Multiply that by a few millions click a day and you have a pretty nice cashflow with a barebones team and an adserver setup in some third world country. In a time in which Google CPCs were growing steadily, this was also a great way to build up some cheap traffic for most advertisers and beef up the media plans with some crazy discounts for media agencies.\n\nThinking of this as a marketplace, if they had managed to find a buyer side with the installer and scale it pretty quickly, the seller side was also going growing steadily. They joined a number of affiliate networks happy to provide creatives for all sorts of CPL and CPC campaigns. With that sort of volume, the affiliate side of the business alone was incredibly profitable.\n\nBut there I was, working for one of the most annoying things ever created on the internet, the heir of the <strong>infamous browser toolbar plugin</strong>.\n\n<a href=\"https://timhwang.org/\">Someone did a good deal of research on this</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Subprime-Attention-Crisis-Advertising-Originals/dp/0374538654/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3A8E8ANUXTR9&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YL89ZftHE5IvZ_YvkKxiAAAP3jXFcfkn3APKszsvZyqNQBg5x-2hT12HpJeQhq5of5EQjJp3V3haIiO_C5iuvNmyWkpLrDWU2HmKNkX0bJ8.SVmoROndgXRu5aoR7rgFnkrv6Bhbwi6Mp5wZNandufc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=subprime+attention+crisis&amp;qid=1734816394&amp;sprefix=subprime+attention+crisi%2Caps%2C328&amp;sr=8-1\">I can only recommend his book</a>. At the end of the day, besides my own anecdotical experience and despite being a few good actors operating in the market, <strong>much of the inventory on programmatic exchanges is rubbish</strong>. Many publishers and marketers don't have the resources or knowhow to navigate this complicated landscape. As a result, enormous amounts of ad spend are wasted on inaccurate targeting, opaque pricing structures, and outright fraud.\n<h3>Don't hate the player, hate the game (maybe both)</h3>\nTo this day I avoid to mention this job in my resume. It is funny that one of the worst experience I ever had from a professional standpoint, was also one of the most insightful and made me understand some of the inner workings of the modern commercial internet. Most importantly, it was a textbook example of gaming the system, and I couldn\u2019t ignore it.\n\nWas it legal? I would say yes, but only because it wasn't explicitly illegal. Clearly this wasn't the first and won't be the last internet business based on some murky technical setup.\n\nHowever, every part involved was also completely aware of how deceitful and unethical this was. The download portals were funneling millions of downloads of unsafe software to uneducated users for the most part, affiliate networks never run any sort of diligence on the source of the traffic, neither as media agencies did and advertisers were mostly too stupid to even ask where the ads were run and the clicks were coming from.\n\nLatest I recall was that the company was likely shut down after a few months (probably it was only a matter of time before either the botnet was killed by some update or the investors truly realized how borderline illegal this was becoming). Companies like this can only last if they manage to find some legal avenue to grow and still make enough money to survive but they really unable to have any significant success - too much of a legal liability even in countries where this sort of things are not clearly regulated.\n\nOne of the founders seemed to have rebuilt the same company in Latin-america, likely taking advantage of a more lax legal environment. In his Linkedin profile he boasts about bootstrapping multiple companies to million dollar exits, and he is know involved in some weird business based in some Mexican border town. One wonders what can take you from running a performance marketing business in Europe to a medical center in one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico... and becoming a CFO, as his profile mentions - a glaring proof of his ethical standing. He seems he also had the time to get a hair transplant - he looks much younger now.\n\nFunnily enough, my next job was at a media agency...",

      "content_html": "I find this difference extremely compelling, especially considering my time spent working in startups. Startups move fast, sometime break things or end up breaking themselves, but they do have a weird relationship with knowledge. More specifically, they struggle more than bigger companies at <strong>transforming cyclical knowledge into compound and functional knowledge.</strong>\n\nOne of the most evident examples of this challenge in startups is in <strong>customer acquisition and retention strategies</strong>. This was extremely apparent in the last startup I've worked at [...].\n\nIt seemed to have an insane handicap to acquire and retain functional knowledge to then compound it. Same with financial and performance data - it seemed that everyone was so struggling to make sense of things and invest those learnings with the next round of initiatives. Every quarter was the same old story - no focus on learnings, knowledge was siloed in a few people with the relevant analytics background but unwilling to share or evangelize, little or no reinvestment of knowledge from previous experience.\n<h4><strong>The Issue with Cyclical Knowledge</strong></h4>\nStartups often operate in short, iterative cycles\u2014launching campaigns, testing new channels, and quickly pivoting based on immediate feedback. While this approach helps them move fast and experiment, it tends to foster cyclical knowledge, or at least it should. They learn what works <em>for the moment</em> (e.g., which ad creative converts better this week or which email sequence drives signups), but that knowledge is often siloed, fragmented, or quickly forgotten as they chase the next big idea.\n\nA few things are in the way of compounding knowledge from cyclical to functional:\n<ul>\n \t<li><em>Turnout rates</em> - folks coming and going within a few months-years at best\n<ul>\n \t<li>startups frequently face turnover or role changes, which can lead to gaps in functional knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><em>Managers and leadership uncomfortable with prioritizing documentation</em> and process-based workflows to retain knowledge\n<ul>\n \t<li>They may not have the time, tools, or team bandwidth to properly document campaign learnings, analyze performance trends over time, or extract principles that could guide future decisions</li>\n \t<li>Coming from a bigger corporate role previously to joining, I s</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><em>lack of proper post-mortem analysis and in general data analysis capabilities</em>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Unlike more established companies with robust processes, startups often lack the infrastructure to transform these lessons into compound knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><em>the focus on the short term and always looking forward mentality</em> (e.g. next round, next quarter etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>The Struggle to Build Compound Knowledge</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p3\">Cyclical knowledge, and the inability to fully learn from others\u2019 past experiences, means you have to accept a level of volatility and fragility not found in other fields.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Some fields have quantifiable truths, while others are guided by vague beliefs and individual circumstances</b>. Physicist Richard Feynman said, \u201c<a href=\"https://x.com/ProfFeynman/status/967807586589265922\">Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.</a>\u201d Well, people do. So any topic guided by behavior \u2013 money, philosophy, relationships, etc. \u2013 can\u2019t be solved with a formula like physics and math.</p>\nBut in the case of companies and organizations, there is a degree to which you can build on cyclical experience to create compound and functional knowledge.\n\nThis distinction between <strong>cyclical, compound, and functional knowledge isn't just theoretical</strong>\u2014it's a lens through which companies can critically evaluate their biggest blind spots. Without systems to retain, share, and build upon knowledge, organizations end up spinning their wheels, repeating the same mistakes, and missing opportunities for growth. While the fast pace and focus on innovation are part of what makes a startup exciting, they must <strong>balance this with deliberate efforts to transform fleeting insights into lasting knowledge.</strong>\n\nStartups that recognize the importance of investing in knowledge\u2014not just the next product launch or funding round\u2014stand a far better chance of breaking the cycle. By <strong>prioritizing documentation, creating a culture of shared learning, and embracing processes that make knowledge accessible</strong>, they can bridge the gap between cyclical and compound knowledge. In doing so, they not only move faster but also smarter, turning short-term wins into sustainable success. Companies that succeed aren\u2019t necessarily the ones that break the most things\u2014they\u2019re the ones that figure out how to learn, adapt, and build on the pieces.\n<p class=\"p3\"></p>",

      "content_html": "Learning to code can be daunting and challenging. It\u2019s easy to fall into what\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qrlx5m/what_exactly_is_tutorial_hell/\">\"tutorial hell\"</a>\u2014an endless sequence of tutorials that often have little impact on real learning. A few years ago, one weekend, I stumbled upon a quick tutorial showing how to build and deploy a fully functional URL shortener. Although a URL shortener is a relatively basic product, it\u2019s an excellent project for learning the fundamentals of I/O with a live database, input filtering and cleaning, and data storage.\n\nAt the time, my coding knowledge was limited to what I could do on my own machine. I wanted to learn how to deploy a Python app properly. The URL shortener seemed like a manageable short-term project to work on while building foundational skills to eventually create a fully-fledged SaaS product.\n<h3>Adding a Unique Feature</h3>\nI wanted to develop something slightly more advanced than a simple shortener. My tool would generate a downloadable, unique QR code for each shortened URL, allowing users to bring those links into the real world. I was intrigued by the potential use cases and curious to see how people might start spreading links. This was pre-COVID so I wasn't really envisioning any \"scan the QR code for the menu\" type of use case. For someone learning to program, this offered an interesting challenge, at least at a basic level.\n<h3>The Role of URL Shorteners</h3>\nURL shorteners have been around for a long time. Their use case is straightforward: URLs can grow excessively long and hard to decipher, especially with the development of the modern internet. A shortener increases the portability and shareability of lengthy URLs. The rise of CGI (the primary driver of URL length explosion) certainly contributed to the demand for such tools.\n\nOne interesting property of URL shorteners, however, is their ability to obscure the original referral source. This can be both annoying to webmasters and useful to malicious users. If you\u2019ve worked in web analytics, you know how frustrating it is to see traffic from a URL shortener without being able to trace back the original source. While some services, like <a href=\"https://bitly.com/\">Bit.ly</a>, have built businesses around improving tracking, this obfuscation can still present challenges. In a cookie-less world, URL shorteners remain a useful tool for many applications.\n<h3>Use Cases\u2014The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h3>\nMasking the original URL is beneficial for various users\u2014some legitimate and others less so. I analysed the shortened URLs almost daily, and I've never run out of surprises so far... Here are a few notable examples:\n<h4><strong>Phishing Attempts</strong></h4>\nPhishing accounts for the majority of malicious uses. Typically, scammers set up a mirror website of a popular platform on free hosting services, send phishing emails with shortened links, and hope users won\u2019t notice they\u2019re entering credentials into a fake site. URL shorteners make the original host URL less obvious, increasing the likelihood of success. Some even pair shortened URLs with QR codes to further obscure their tracks and avoid liability. My most faithful users/scammers come from either far east or African countries and they tend to target US and EU based users. Sometimes we play a cat and mouse game in which they post the link, I remove it and they post it again not once but 5 times, just to be sure.\n<h4><strong>Stolen Goods/Weapons Black Market</strong></h4>\nSurprisingly, a noticeable percentage of links created with the service (around 20%) appear to lead to pages advertising stolen goods or black-market weapons. While I\u2019m unsure how much of this traffic relies on QR codes versus direct links, it\u2019s an unsettling trend.\nKind of weird to think I've played some part in someone purchasing a M4 at some point.\n<h4><strong>Ukraine Fundraisers</strong></h4>\nThere have also been sketchy attempts to raise funds for Ukrainian troops, complete with functional checkout pages where users can donate significant amounts of money. The legitimacy of these fundraisers is dubious at best.\n<h4><strong>Onion Links</strong></h4>\nWhile I\u2019ve never delved into the specifics of dark web links, some users clearly take advantage of URL shorteners to obscure onion links. I assume there are already shorteners tailored for the dark web, but it seems this practice has spilled over into regular shorteners as well. I have never really checked out the destination links in the end, for some reason I have a feeling this is not legal content and neither I want to check if I'm really wrong at this point.\n<h4><strong>Conspiracy Theory Content</strong></h4>\nThis is the funniest stuff by far. There\u2019s a persistent flow of conspiracy theory content. I actively police and remove these links, often recognizing users through a combination of the links themselves and their country of origin. Interestingly, even after I remove these links, some users continue distributing the now-dead links, causing spikes in 505 errors from recipients trying to access non-redirecting URLs.\n<h3>Reflecting on the Experience</h3>\nIn the end, it wasn't that much of technical challenge but I've learned a few things for sure. To some extent, the internet is still that wild and unpredictable environment that it was back in my early days, which is both reassuring and scary at the same time. From conspiracy theories to phishing attempts and guns black market, there's still plenty happening at the edge of the internet.",

As a bored teenager with a 56k dialup, hacking and security where more of a past time, but I only know realize the importance of that deliberate practice in understanding some of the most relevant concept of the internet.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">One of the earliest and mostly cited exploit of the early days of the internet was the PHF.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">A PHF (Publicly accessible Hypertext Function) exploit is a type of attack that was used in the mid-90s to exploit a vulnerable CGI (Common Gateway Interface) script. The \"phf\" script, typically found on older web servers, was originally designed to provide a phonebook functionality via a web interface. However, due to improper input sanitization, it was susceptible to remote command execution, allowing attackers to run arbitrary commands on the web server.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Attackers could craft a URL to exploit the phf script by sending commands to the web server. By manipulating the input, attackers could make the script execute shell commands on the server. The vulnerability was in how the script processed input parameters.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">http://example.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Nowadays this is almost completely impossible to ind in</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Combining that level of curiosity with few schoolmates with similar interests, I started playing around with code and came up with my own client/server applications and later coding some of the most common exploits at the time. I was right in between a script kid and someone with a bit more advanced knowledge, able to translate exploit papers into actual code.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">A <b>Smurf attack</b> is a type of <b>distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</b> attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the Internet Protocol (IP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). Here's how it works:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><b>Attacker sends ICMP echo request (ping) packets</b> to a network broadcast address, typically using the victim's IP address as the source IP (spoofing the victim).</li>\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><b>All devices on the network</b> that receive the broadcasted ping request reply back with an ICMP echo reply (ping response), flooding the victim's system with traffic.</li>\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><b>Flooding the victim's network</b> with these responses can overwhelm its resources (bandwidth, CPU), causing service disruptions or complete unavailability of the targeted system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b>SQL Injection (SQLi)</b></p>\n\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><b>How it worked:</b> Attackers inserted malicious SQL code into input fields (usually web forms) to manipulate or access databases. Poor input validation made this attack common.</li>\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><b>Example:</b>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n \t<li class=\"li3\">The <i>first publicized SQL injection</i> occurred around 1998, but the technique was rampant throughout the 2000s, compromising databases and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b>5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b></p>\n\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><b>How it worked:</b> Attackers injected malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. These scripts could steal session tokens, credentials, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.</li>\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><b>Example:</b>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n \t<li class=\"li3\">XSS attacks became more widespread with the rise of interactive websites and forums in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Reddit, with its vast array of communities, passionate discussions, and sometimes messy threads, at least to me bears an uncanny resemblance to Usenet. For those who weren't there already at that time, Usenet was quite a special place and truly a legacy system.\n<h3>A Brief History: What is/was Usenet?</h3>\nUsenet, short for <strong>\"User Network,\"</strong> was one of the earliest systems for online communication and discussion, predating the modern web. It was created in 1980 by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis at Duke University, initially as a way for people to post messages and share files across a decentralized network of computers.\n\nUsenet wasn't like modern websites or forums; it operated more like a <strong>distributed bulletin board system</strong>. There was no central server\u2014rather, Usenet relied on a network of servers that passed messages back and forth between each other. Users could post messages to <strong>\"newsgroups\"</strong>, which were the equivalent of forums or discussion threads.\n\nI remember signing up for different newsgroups on my own Outlook client and see the new messages flooding in. I remember there were multiple clients but having your own email client able to download a manage messages was great and it quickly became engrained in my daily routine.\n\nThe array of content available was also pretty amazing. From purely text based messaging to binary files for all types of stuff [...]. It was so broad in scope and topics that you could quickly find something truly interesting to you. Eventually you would end up engaging consistently with certain communities and becoming part of them. I guess the reason why I also got so deep into it was the lack of any significant alternative - I never really enjoyed any other type of forums, even though the logic would have been the same.\n\nWhile Usenet has largely faded from mainstream awareness, it hasn't completely disappeared. Many <strong>private Usenet providers</strong> still exist, catering mostly to niche users, particularly those interested in file sharing.\n\nThe combination of social media, the rise of web2.0, spam, abuse and decline in moderation, not to mention providers charging even small amount of money for it, sort of killed it for good. It is still available, but most of those communities died and it is used to exchange larger files for the most part.\n<h3><strong>The Power of Communities (or Newsgroups)</strong></h3>\nOn Usenet, conversations were organized into \u201cnewsgroups.\u201d These were the digital neighborhoods where discussions happened, and they were often specific to a topic or interest. Sounds familiar, right? Reddit\u2019s subreddits are essentially the same thing\u2014a place for like-minded individuals to share information, opinions, memes, and, yes, even heated arguments.\n\nJust like Usenet\u2019s newsgroups, Reddit\u2019s subreddits are user-driven and self-moderated. Communities decide their own rules, and participation shapes the experience. Whether you\u2019re diving into r/technology for the latest gadgets or r/CatGifs for, well, endless cat gifs, there\u2019s a sense of belonging that echoes Usenet\u2019s early communities.\n<h3><strong>Decentralized Discussions, Global Reach and Censorship</strong></h3>\nUsenet wasn\u2019t owned by any one entity\u2014it was decentralized. This structure allowed anyone, anywhere, to access and post to newsgroups as long as they had a newsreader and an internet connection. While Reddit is centrally controlled, its decentralized <em>feel</em> stems from the autonomy of its subreddits. Each community is governed by its own moderators, rules, and culture, creating a space that feels independent, even within the larger Reddit ecosystem.\n\nThis sense of \"everyone's welcome\" is something both platforms share. You don\u2019t need to be a tech wizard to participate\u2014both Usenet and Reddit have made global discussion possible in a relatively open and accessible way.\n\nBut this is where the dystopian bit comes in. Usenet was a early days internet legacy, built on the notion that infrastructure had to be independently managed and had no business ties with any specific company. This prevent conflict of interests to the benefit of the communities. While they had to actively police themselves to comply with basic standards, there wasn't a centralized organization needing to steer content to one or another way.\n\nReddit, on the other hand, has a rich history of censorship.\u00a0 Reddit has faced several controversial cases of censorship over the years. Key incidents include the banning of <strong>r/FatPeopleHate</strong> and <strong>r/The_Donald</strong>, which were seen as attacks on free speech, and the <strong>r/WallStreetBets</strong> restrictions during the GameStop surge, sparking accusations of financial censorship. Reddit also took action against COVID-19 misinformation by banning subreddits like <strong>r/NoNewNormal</strong>. Allegations of censorship related to Chinese influence emerged after <strong>Tencent\u2019s investment</strong>, and users often accuse Reddit of suppressing discussions about its own moderation practices.\n<h3>3. <strong>Anonymity and Pseudonyms Rule</strong></h3>\nIf you\u2019ve ever spent time on Reddit, you\u2019ll know that anonymity is supposed to be a key feature. Until not long ago, you could just join without even using an email address. Now you're essentially forced to provide it. And yes, most users post under pseudonyms or random usernames, rarely revealing their real identities, but you can tell that the product is evolving into leveraging content and specific user identities so that users can actively promote their own content (think of all the /selfie posters who pretend to genuinely share random pictures while actually trying to redirect users to their OF pages).\n\nUsenet was a bare-bone services, so you didn't have much to express yourself besides your own username. This anonymity fosters a sense of freedom (and, sometimes, chaos). People feel liberated to share their opinions, expertise, or rants\u2014just like they did on Usenet. Of course, both platforms have struggled with the dark side of anonymity, like trolls, flame wars, and less-than-savory content, but the open dialogue it enables is part of what made/makes both platforms so popular.\n<h3>4. <strong>Content Is King, But Threads Are Messy</strong></h3>\nOne of the defining features of Usenet was the threaded discussion format. Replies were often buried deep within threads, creating a layered, sometimes chaotic conversation flow. Reddit continues this tradition. While it has a more polished design, Reddit threads can become just as sprawling and disorganized as Usenet's. Dive into a hot debate on r/politics or a long-winded argument on r/gaming, and you\u2019ll feel that old-school Usenet vibe of trying to follow a multi-threaded conversation that spans hundreds of comments.\n\nBoth platforms prioritize the content of the discussion itself over slick presentation. Usenet was about the message, not the medium\u2014and Reddit, with its text-heavy posts and long threads, follows the same principle.\n<h3>5. <strong>Niche Interests Thrive</strong></h3>\nOne of the things that made Usenet special was its ability to cater to the most obscure of interests. You could find a newsgroup dedicated to anything\u2014whether it was astrophysics or Japanese anime. Reddit is no different. There are subreddits for topics so niche you didn\u2019t even know they existed, from r/showerthoughts (random thoughts you have in the shower) to r/illegallysmolcats (for cats that are \u201ctoo small\u201d).\n\nThis ability to cater to micro-interests makes Reddit feel like the spiritual successor to Usenet. No matter how obscure your passion or curiosity, you can bet there\u2019s a subreddit or two (or a hundred) devoted to it.\n<h3>6. <strong>Both Platforms Love Their Gatekeepers</strong></h3>\nUsenet and Reddit share one other commonality: they\u2019re both fiercely protective of their cultures. Just like Usenet had its die-hard users who maintained the \u201cright way\u201d to post and discuss, Reddit has its own gatekeepers. These are the moderators and long-time users who enforce the unwritten rules of their communities, making sure things run smoothly (or, at least, according to their version of smooth).\n\nOn both platforms, there\u2019s an element of \"in-group\" behavior. To really thrive, you need to understand how the platform works, the etiquette of each group, and the subtle social cues. It can feel a little intimidating to newcomers, but it\u2019s also part of the charm.\n<h3>So, Is Reddit the New Usenet?</h3>\nIn many ways, yes. Reddit has succeeded in recreating much of what made Usenet great\u2014wide-ranging, decentralized discussions, the ability to cater to niche communities, and the freedom (and risk) of anonymous speech. It\u2019s a little cleaner, a little more accessible, but deep down, Reddit is just the modern-day version of those early Usenet newsgroups.\n\nBoth platforms have been places where internet culture is born and shaped, where communities thrive, and where, despite the messiness of it all, people keep coming back to participate in the conversation. So, next time you\u2019re browsing through your favorite subreddit, remember\u2014you're just continuing a tradition that started decades ago, when the internet was a simpler, text-only space, and Usenet ruled the digital landscape.\n\nTo me, this is just another way the hyper commercialization of the internet . If I think of my own browsing habits, I tend to jump around between Facebook, Reddit and maybe Hackernews, always looking for the latest think that would trigger even a slight dopamine release. I tend to indulge in nostalgia quite a bit, but the amazement of discovery in content is completely lost, we're so much trapped into our feeds that it is hardly anything new and or relevant to enjoy. Not sure if Usenet was truly that, but",
